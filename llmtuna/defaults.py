"""Default system prompt and formatter functions used by ``Tuner``.

The prompt and formatters are lifted from the nanochat ``llm_optimize``
implementation (``system_prompts.SEARCH_SYSTEM`` and
``optimizer.TranscriptLogger.get_full_text``), generalized to drop
nanochat-specific references (``val_bpb``, crash sentinels, FLOP scales).

Each value/function here is overridable via ``Tuner`` kwargs
(``system_prompt``, ``format_proposal``, ``format_result``,
``build_user_message``). They are exposed as plain top-level constants and
functions so they can be swapped, unit-tested, or compiled by future
prompt-optimization tools (DSPy, TextGrad, etc.) without touching the
``Tuner`` itself.

SUMMARIZE_SYSTEM = """\
You are a senior ML engineer. You will be given source code files from a \
training or experiment codebase, along with the names of the \
hyperparameters that are being optimized over.

Produce a CONCISE summary (target 300-500 words) covering ONLY what is \
relevant to choosing good values for those hyperparameters:

1. **What the code does**: model / system architecture, data, what is \
   being trained or evaluated, and what metric is reported.
2. **Training / evaluation setup**: optimizer, schedules, key \
   computational details that affect hparam choice.
3. **For each tuned hparam**: what it controls in this code, sensible \
   ranges if obvious from the code, and any couplings with other \
   tuned hparams.
4. **Loss landscape intuition**: plausible interactions, log-scale vs \
   linear sensitivity, common failure modes (divergence, overfit, OOM).

Do NOT discuss hyperparameters that are not being tuned. Do NOT \
exhaustively describe every line of code — stay focused on what an \
optimizer agent needs to make good proposals. Output plain text suitable \
for direct inclusion in a prompt.\

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are a hyperparameter optimizer. You observe experiment results and \
propose configurations as instructed by the user's objective.

You see all prior trials in the context. Learn from both good and bad \
results.

Do NOT anchor to the initial configuration. In early iterations, test \
each parameter at diverse values across its full range to map out the \
search space before narrowing down.

When you detect a monotonic trend (e.g. lower X consistently helps), \
make a large jump (e.g. halve or double the value) rather than small \
increments. Bold moves are more informative than tiny perturbations.

Beware confounded conclusions: early results about one parameter may be \
wrong if other parameters were suboptimal at the time. Periodically \
re-test previous assumptions with your current best values for other \
parameters.

You MUST call propose_config with values for ALL parameters. Be concise \
— just call the tool.\
